Every feature you add (EDA, Modeling, Graphs, whatever) should have its own branch.

When you've completed the work on the feature, you should commit and make a pull request to master.

Once the feature branch has been merged to master, you can delete the old branch off of your computer.



Creating a branch for a new feature:
- git pull origin master
- git checkout -b feature-branch-name-here


Committing changes and making a pull request to merge with master:
- on your feature branch: git commit -m 'message'
- Go to the project repository and deal with any pull requests.
    https://git.generalassemb.ly/gerket/project-4
    - Pull Requests tab has any number other than 0
    - Click on the name of the pull request
    - Read comment, see if any merge conflicts exist, maybe look at the code idk
    - If everything's good, confirm the pull and merge
- git checkout master
- git pull origin master
- git checkout feature-branch-name-here
- git merge master
    - you probably need a message here. Either add " -m 'message contents' " to the line above or if that doesn't work execute the line above and enter your message into the text editor that comes up, save, and keep going.
- git push origin feature-branch-name-here
- go to the Github repository website, create a pull request, and have another team member review and merge your PR.
    https://git.generalassemb.ly/gerket/project-4
    - click on "new pull request" button
    - *IMPORTANT* 'base fork' needs to be gerket/project 4. Once you change this it should reload and only have 'base' and 'compare' options. 'compare' should be 'feature-branch-name-here'.
    - create pull request / describe your changes (whichever came first) and then message the group to have someone else check your work / accept your pull


Deleting your old branch:
- git checkout master
- git branch -D feature-branch-name-here
- git pull origin master
