# Kaggle Competition - Starter

## Introduction

Welcome to your first week of work at the Disease And Treatment Agency, division of Societal Cures In Epidemiology and New Creative Engineering (DATA-SCIENCE). Time to get to work!

Due to the recent epidemic of West Nile Virus in the Windy City, we've had the Department of Public Health set up a surveillance and control system. We're hoping it will let us learn something from the mosquito population as we collect data over time. Pesticides are a necessary evil in the fight for public health and safety, not to mention expensive! We need to derive an effective plan to deploy pesticides throughout the city, and that is **exactly** where you come in!

This project was a joint effort between Emma York, Tom Gerke, Tom Kelly, and Varan Sachi. They are not collaborators on this github repo because it has been pulled over from a GitHub Enterprise server after the fact. The presentation for this project is hosted on [Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hTrUtZChl4ZUvechKBLHWLia4Ky0SejUDCXj_PQJHNc/edit?usp=sharing).

## Filetree
- ``/assets/``: All of the .csv data and output that we generated
- ``/emma/``: Emma York's working directory
- ``/tk/``: Tom Kelly's working directory
- ``/tomg/``: Tom Gerke's working directory
- ``/varan/``: Varan Sachi's working directory
- `Final Eda.ipynb`: The final version of the EDA that we implemented
- `Modeling.ipynb`: The final version of the modeling that we implemented
- `instructions.txt`: Instructions for how the team used github with branches and not step on each others' toes

## Dataset

The dataset, along with description, can be found here: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/](https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-west-nile-virus/).

## Deliverables
**Goals**
1. The goal is of course to build a model and make predictions that the city of Chicago can use when it decides where to spray pesticides!
2. Conduct a cost-benefit analysis. This should include annual cost projections for various levels of pesticide coverage (cost) and the effect of these various levels of pesticide coverage (benefit).
3. Your final submission CSV should be in your GitHub repo.

**Presentation**
* Audience: You are presenting to members of the CDC. Some members of the audience will be biostatisticians and epidemiologists who will understand your models and metrics and will want more information. Others will be decision-makers, focusing almost exclusively on your cost-benefit analysis. Your job is to convince both groups of the best course of action in the same meeting and be able to answer questions that either group may ask.
* The length of your presentation should be about 20 minutes
